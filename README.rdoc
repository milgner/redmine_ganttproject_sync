= ganttproject_sync

This is a plugin for Redmine (http://www.redmine.org) to synchronize an issue tracker with data from a GanttProject file.

The actual issue tracking and management is done in a public project at my personal Redmine installation at http://redmine.marcusilgner.com/projects/ganttprojectsync
There you may also find a demo installation to see the plugin in action: https://redmine.marcusilgner.com/projects/gpsyncdemo (use gpsync/gpsync as login credentials)
